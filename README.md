# Pizza Hunt

## Description
Pizza Hunt is an application made for pizza fanatics. It allows users to share their favorite pizzas with others. They can choose the toppings they like, enter their name, and even what size pizza. They can then post their pizza recipe where others can see it and comment on it to start a discussion. It's the perfect place to find pizza inspiration as well as brag about your favorite recipes you've created.
